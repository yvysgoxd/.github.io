Currently, I'm doing my 2019 summer internship at Yahoo! as a product designer working on new features and visuals for app Yahoo Play. I am also happy to be one of the holiday doodler messing up our logo on Yahoo.com ;) 

I'm going to graduate in December 2019 for my 2-year MFA in Visual Communication Design with a focus on UI/UX interaction Design and a minor on illustration at Rochester Institute of Technology. 

I found myself fascinated by making the interaction flow more friendly and creating various illustrations to served for the digital products. That was the moment I realized that I'm going to be a Product Illustrator / Designer in this world.
